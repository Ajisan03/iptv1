Don't get me wrong,
you are indeed a thief,

The Detective is still processing
my Devil face.

The last thing she needs
is a demon tracking her down.

Or...

along on the trip.

And then I can apologize to Trixie.

You know, Mazikeen...

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.539
I'm starting to think
it's not a question of when...

with what Daniel's going through,

something I bear no responsibility.

It's gonna take him a while, Lucifer.

It's...

-Uh, actually, no.

No, I didn't want to give Daniel
the satisfaction, but...

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.276
I think it's time
I stopped coming to crime scenes.

without helping at all?

Yes. I've been holding on
to a false hope, it seems.

Quite foolish, really,
that one day she'd just...

Who knew beekeeping was kind of badass?

It looks like one of the hives
was attacked.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:55.326
So maybe Bob caught the killer
stomping on his poor bees and they fought?

00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:57.495
Possibly. Any witnesses?

00:08:57.578 --> 00:08:59.705
None.
But Bob's wife, Lenore, is over there.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:15.304
[Lenore sniffles]
No one hated Bob. He was a gentle soul.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.390
He never even raised his voice.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.184
And you can't think of anybody
who may have wanted to hurt him?

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:21.394
I can't.

00:09:22.186 --> 00:09:23.062
I mean, we...

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.648
We sell honey
at the farmers' market together.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.775
It's just one big family over there.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.986
[Chloe] All right...

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:32.196
I'm... right in the middle of something.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.240
So, go on.

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:36.033
[Lenore] I, um...

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.412
I can't imagine...

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.374
I'm so sorry, excuse me.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.002
Could I speak with you?

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:52.425
Lucifer, her husband was just murdered.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:53.634
Are you...

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:55.928
okay?

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.389
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:09:59.599
Where did you go?

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:03.644
Oh, uh, I took Trixie to Europe
and we traveled around and...

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:05.896
you know, it gave me time to...

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.274
to process what I saw.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:09.775
And...

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.485
have you processed?

00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:13.195
Are-- Are you...

00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:15.448
okay with what you saw?

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.074
-I--
-Detective...

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.493
are you okay with me?

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.747
It's not like you haven't always
told me the truth.

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:24.248
You know?

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:25.875
So...

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:28.002
I think, deep down, I just...

00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:29.920
I always knew.

00:10:30.004 --> 00:10:31.464
But how does it make you feel?

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.883
Afraid? Terrified?
Do you want to yell at me?

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:36.260
Punch me in the face? Run away again?

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:37.678
[Chloe] I...

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:39.847
I think I just want to get back to work.

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:41.223
That's all?

00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:42.975
That's all.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.193
What the f...

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:54.278
[theme music playing]

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:05.122
I'm glad I've come to talk to you
all these years, Linda.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:09.335
You've opened my eyes,
helped me understand how emotions work.

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.462
Thank you, Lucifer. That's...

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.297
wonderful to hear.

00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:18.010
Once again, your insight
has helped me come to a realization.

00:11:20.137 --> 00:11:21.806
The Detective is clearly in denial.

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:22.807
Ah.

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:24.892
Of course.

00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:28.938
How else to explain
her complete non-reaction to my true self?

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:30.439
Help me, Doctor.

00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:32.191
Help me help her.

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:36.862
-Well, what did you want to hear from her?
-What I want isn't important.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:37.988
I disagree.

00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:40.491
What Chloe is going through is...

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.787
incredibly difficult.

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.956
Trust me, I know from experience.

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.625
But I'm your therapist.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.585
Not hers.

00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:55.214
And I wonder if whether you expected

00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:57.216
her to reject you.

00:11:58.342 --> 00:11:59.885
Maybe even wanted her to.

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:02.012
Well, why on earth
would I want her to reject me?

00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:05.641
Because your Devil face has returned
and you've refused to talk about it.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.435
[sighs, scoffs]

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.147
There's not much to say, really.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.066
I killed a human for the first time,
my Devil face returned.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.402
I don't think it's as simple as that.

00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:19.613
Killing a human is against
your father's rules, not your own.

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:23.117
And you've recently learned
that angels self-actualize.

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:24.410
So you think...

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.037
that I'm punishing myself
for killing a human?

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.706
I'm wondering if...

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.584
you're punishing yourself for enjoying it.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:34.587
[Lucifer scoffs]

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.381
So what if I did?

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:41.594
Then perhaps that's why you see yourself
as evil again.

00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:45.765
And perhaps that's why
you want Chloe to reject you.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:47.433
I don't want her to reject me.

00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:49.685
She told you she's fine.

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:52.980
What if what she told you is...

00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:55.733
actually simply the truth?

00:12:55.983 --> 00:12:57.359
And what if it isn't?

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.029
She'll find a way to let you know.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.908
So you're saying I should just act
as if everything is as she claims...

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:08.287
then slowly poke at her denial
and find a way to pop the bubble.

00:13:09.997 --> 00:13:14.251
I know nothing I can say
is going to stop you from doing that.

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.170
But all I can ask is...

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:18.631
Take it slowly.

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:21.383
[laughing] Of course, Doctor.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:23.719
Baby steps.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:26.472
I'm the Devil.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.391
[Chloe] Lucifer, what are you doing?

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.102
Detective, it's time Miss Lopez
finally knew the truth.

00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:36.357
[Lucifer] I am the angel who led
a rebellion against my father, God.

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:38.776
I was banished to Hell afterwards,

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:41.278
where I ruled as king
over the souls of the damned.

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:44.949
Lucifer, it all makes sense now.

00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:53.541
Damn it, I tried to keep a straight face,
I really did.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:57.670
Man, how?
How do you stay in character like that?

00:13:57.753 --> 00:13:59.505
It's simple really. It's all true.

00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:02.049
Oh, and my brother, Amenadiel,
he's an angel.

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:04.844
Ah, does he have wings?

00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:06.512
-He does again actually.
-[both laugh]

00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:09.181
-You think he can give me a ride?
-You should ask him.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.934
-[Lucifer laughs]
-This guy. You're so funny!

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:15.646
Ah! Why would you think that I'm not
telling the truth, Miss Lopez?

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:17.523
I stopped trying to figure that out
years ago.

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:20.693
I mean, hey, we all got our quirks, right?

00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:22.778
Mine is that I'm, like,
actually the Devil.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.113
-Oh, right!
-[Lucifer laughs]

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.073
-[Chloe laughs]
-[Ella laughs]

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:28.993
Oh, so do you have any new info
on the case?

00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:30.077
Uh, yes.

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:31.829
So, it turns out

00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:34.582
the honey scraper couldn't have
belonged to the victim's collection,

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:37.501
because it had, wait for it...

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.045
honey on it.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:41.589
And isn't that the point?

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:44.216
[Ella]
Bob and Lenore's specialty was varietals.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.469
You know, blueberry honey,
cinnamon honey. But this right here...

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:50.055
good, old-fashioned plain honey, honey.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:52.016
So this honey came from somewhere else.

00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:54.935
So maybe a rival came with his own tool
to destroy the hive.

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:57.187
And then used it to kill Bob
when he caught them.

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:59.815
How devilish. And I would know, after all.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:00.983
You're the Devil.

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:02.276
[laughing] I really am.

00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:03.652
[Ella laughs]

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:04.945
[clears throat] Right.

00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:07.698
[Lucifer] Isn't this fun, Detective?

00:15:07.781 --> 00:15:08.657
[Chloe] What's that?

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:12.202
Well, now you know the truth about me
and, as you said, fine with it...

00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:15.039
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, we can both be in on the joke.

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:19.460
You can watch humans twist themselves
into pretzels to justify what I tell them

00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:21.587
instead of considering
the most obvious answer.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.924
-[Chloe] I think it's kind of mean.
-What?

00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:28.761
Well, no-one in their right mind
is going to believe

00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:31.096
that you're actually, you know, the Devil.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.098
-Oh.
-Well, without proof.

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:36.518
So of course they're going to try
and figure out the metaphor.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.605
Or perhaps you're just smarting
from never figuring it out yourself.

00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:41.440
-[chuckles]
-Maybe a little bit.

00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:45.444
So here's Bob and Lenore's stand.
They're newer to the farmers' market.

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:48.906
Whereas Pure Honey,
they've been here for years.

00:15:49.406 --> 00:15:51.909
Maybe they didn't like the competition
moving in next door.

00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:55.120
Destroy the rival hive
and suddenly he's back to being queen bee.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:00.668
Detective, since you're clearly
comfortable with my devilishness...

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:02.169
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:04.004
Care to see my mojo in action?

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:05.756
Sure. Why not?

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:07.508
Right.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.259
Welcome.

00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:10.719
What can I get for you?

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.181
Uh, LAPD, Detective Decker.
Do you own this stand?

00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:16.058
Yeah. Glenn Dobbs.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.643
Lovely. Tell me, Glenn...

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:19.937
what is it you desire?

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.105
Excuse me?

00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:23.315
Well, I like to draw out
all those naughty,

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.192
hidden desires of humanity.

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:29.655
Though, you seem like someone
who really wants to unburden himself.

00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:30.781
I...

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.910
[Glenn stammers] I...

00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:36.370
I want...

00:16:36.453 --> 00:16:37.955
-Go on. 
-I...

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:42.835
Wait, w-what's happening?

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:45.671
Lucifer, you may want to...

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:47.881
Right, yes. Glenn...

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.592
Glenn, tell me...

00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:52.469
what is it you desire?

00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:55.973
I want Bob Goldbach to die.

00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:57.182
Oh.

00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:01.228
Case solved, Detective.
Here I was, worried we'd be rusty.

00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:04.732
You want him to die? Why? Because
he was going to threaten your business?

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:06.108
What? No.

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:09.695
-It's because I'm terrified of him.
-[chuckles] You're terrified of Bob?

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:11.822
Chubby, harmless, and very dead Bob?

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:12.948
Bob's dead?

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.074
Very.

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:16.618
Oh, thank God. I can finally relax.

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.162
Why were you scared of Bob?

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:20.789
Let's talk in private.

00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:26.086
[Glenn] Okay, fine.

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:27.963
I destroyed their beehive.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.300
[Glenn] I was pissed
that Bob and Lenore's gimmicky honey

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:33.135
was putting my stand out of business.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.971
I mean, avocado honey?

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.473
Come on.

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:40.267
I'm from LA
and even I think that's going too far.

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:43.062
But when Bob caught you,
you killed him, didn't you?

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:44.730
[Glenn] No, I went home,

00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:47.733
and a couple of hours later,
Bob showed up at my front door.

00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:49.485
So he confronted you. What did he say?

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:50.402
Say?

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:52.321
He didn't say anything.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:53.989
[winces]

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:56.533
Bob did that to you?

00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:58.410
It was like he was a different person.

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:00.037
He wasn't angry. He was...

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.955
He was so calm.

00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:04.541
It made it even scarier, you know?

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.085
What did you do after he left?

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:08.545
Are you kidding me?
I went to the hospital.

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:10.089
Right. Show me again.

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:15.177
Detective, I have definitely
seen work like this before,

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.095
in Hell.

00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:17.679
You know, where I'm...

00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:18.764
Mm-hmm.

00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:19.807
Never mind.

00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:21.683
A bag of billiard balls perhaps.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.435
-Not quite round enough, is it?
-Ow!

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:25.813
It was doorknobs, of all things.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.232
I mean, who does that?

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:31.693
[Chloe] Huh.

00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:35.989
Well, his story checks out. Glenn was
at the hospital at the time of death.

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:38.909
Oh. So Bob wasn't as mild-mannered
as we first thought.

00:18:38.992 --> 00:18:40.452
Hm. Apparently not.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.038
But a bag of doorknobs? It's...

00:18:43.413 --> 00:18:44.748
so specific.

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:45.833
Was it a message?

00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:48.293
If so, it was lost on that poor chap.

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:49.336
Huh.

00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:53.924
[Lucifer] What on earth are you doing?

00:18:54.007 --> 00:18:56.468
[Chloe] I think we're being followed.
Looks like he's got a gun.

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:05.769
Detective, this is a chance
for me to use my devilish strength.

00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:07.437
You can see what I'm truly capable of.

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:09.773
Or I can just point my gun at him
and yell, "Freeze!"

00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:10.983
Oh, come on.

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:13.819
I've never really seen
how far I can actually throw a human.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:16.738
-[sighs]
-Joking. Mostly.

00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:20.367
Okay. He's all yours.

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.287
[man groans]

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.997
[choking]

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.415
Lucifer, stop!

00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:29.626
I see you're not as comfortable
with my true nature as you claim.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.045
What? No, it's not that. He's got a badge!

00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:34.214
[man groans]

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:36.466
[man chokes]

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.010
Why were you following us?

00:19:38.093 --> 00:19:40.971
Because your victim
was in witness protection.

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:46.185
US Marshal Luke Reynolds.

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:49.479
Hi.

00:19:54.484 --> 00:19:55.736
You were Bob's handler?

00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:59.072
I, uh, kept tabs on him,
made sure he was safe.

00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:02.826
Failed pretty spectacularly
at that, though, didn't I?

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.203
You certainly did.

00:20:05.495 --> 00:20:06.455
Well, he asked.

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.582
[Chloe]
So why were you following us outside?

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:10.584
You could have approached us at any time.

00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:13.378
I know. Sorry, but when you're dealing
with someone like Bob the Knob--

00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:16.715
[Lucifer snickers]
Sorry. Seriously? Bob the Knob?

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.674
[Lucifer laughs]

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:20.135
What was he in witness protection for?
Bad porn?

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:23.138
Bob was an enforcer
for the Paradiso crime syndicate.

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:26.642
His signature was beating people half
to death with a bag full of doorknobs.

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:29.102
Paradisos have a pretty ruthless
reputation.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:34.233
I've never dealt with them myself, but
if Bob was high up in the organization...

00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:37.361
They're based out of New York,
but have their fingers everywhere.

00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:39.988
Look, no offense to the LAPD.
I just didn't know who to trust.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.574
Especially since no-one
should've known Bob was here.

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:45.327
So you think
the Paradisos were responsible for this?

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.329
A group of them came to town
a couple of days ago

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:49.039
and I don't think it was
for the sunshine.

00:20:49.122 --> 00:20:51.083
-Did you talk to them?
-What's the point?

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.001
They won't talk to law enforcement.

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.211
Oh, you'd be surprised.

00:20:54.294 --> 00:20:57.339
I mean, after all,
she has the Devil at her side.

00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:01.969
Maybe it is kind of fun being in the know.

00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:15.107
[sighs]

00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:21.321
[keys rattle]

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:22.990
-[Maze] What's up, Decker?
-[gasps]

00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:24.741
Maze.

00:21:26.743 --> 00:21:28.203
You scared me. What...

00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:31.290
What the hell are you doing?

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.166
I heard you were back.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.004
And I know that you know...

00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:39.339
You know.

00:21:39.673 --> 00:21:40.507
Right.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:43.176
So you just hid in the dark and...

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:46.888
waited for the creepiest moment ever
to say something?

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.223
Old habits, I guess.

00:21:50.934 --> 00:21:54.438
Look, I know you're probably
really freaked out, so...

00:21:58.108 --> 00:21:59.234
Good faith gesture.

00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:02.738
I'm locked into these.
You have nothing to worry about.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.240
Look, I need you to know...

00:22:05.907 --> 00:22:07.701
Chloe, that even though I'm a demon...

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:11.997
I would never hurt you.

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:14.374
I know.

00:22:16.209 --> 00:22:17.044
Yeah?

00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:18.545
Really.

00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:20.047
Good.

00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:23.425
Good faith, huh?

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:26.053
Well, you thought you were safe.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.680
That's all that matters, right?

00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:29.639
Is it?

00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:31.308
So where's Trixie?

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.186
I was hoping to see her, too.

00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:36.646
Oh, yeah. Uh...

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:37.731
She's at Dan's.

00:22:37.814 --> 00:22:40.692
You know, obviously,
she hasn't seen him for a while,

00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:43.236
so she's gonna stay with him for a bit.

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:44.488
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:46.031
I'll just swing by and say hi.

00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:47.032
[Chloe] I don't--

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.660
I don't think that's a good idea, Maze.

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:53.705
I knew it.

00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:56.708
She's still upset with me, isn't she?

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.168
[sighs]

00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:02.047
You know, Maze, she is, and I...

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.425
I'm sorry, I just... I don't...

00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:09.012
I don't see her getting over it
anytime soon.

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:13.350
Yeah.

What?

00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:42.712
Well, we both know why you're really here.

00:23:42.796 --> 00:23:43.880
To gloat.

00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:45.924
Lucy, I'm here to make sure
you know the truth.

control over ourselves, like I thought.

I figured it out when you flew up
to Heaven with Charlotte.

00:23:58.145 --> 00:23:59.729
Nice touch on that, by the way.

00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.815
First-class ticket to the Silver City.

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:03.525
Just as she deserved.

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:04.943
I agree.

00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:11.867
You know, 
I'm actually going to miss you, brother.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.618
Miss me? What do you mean?

00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:15.036
Well, your wings are back.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.457
You can finally go home for good,
like you wanted to all this time.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.209
I suppose that has been
my ultimate goal, all right.

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:23.128
Honestly,
I'm surprised you returned at all.

00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:25.255

not what you remember it to be?

00:24:25.338 --> 00:24:26.173
No, no, it's...

00:24:26.756 --> 00:24:28.425
It's exactly as I remember.

00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:30.844
I'm happy for you, brother.
You're getting what you want.

And, surprisingly, I may be as well.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.182
Ah. Now, what's that?

00:24:35.265 --> 00:24:37.309
The Detective knows what I really am.

00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:40.312
Oh, Lucy.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.731
Are you all right?

Do you need my help?

Well, that's just it.

Apparently,
it seems that she's fine with it.

I know. I was skeptical myself, but...

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:53.617
I think it may really be true.

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:54.743
Are you sure?

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:58.330
Because if you need me to stay,
I will stay for as long as it takes--

00:26:04.771 --> 00:26:06.731
If I had to think, it was on the stand,

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:08.233
testifying against my uncle.

00:26:08.692 --> 00:26:10.902
Getting himself a sweet deal
in the process.

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:11.820
He's lying.

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:15.031
Although you probably knew that,
what with him being a mobster and all.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.658
But I actually have proof.

00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:20.245
I made a little discovery
whilst investigating the cheese platter.

00:26:20.537 --> 00:26:21.621
It's delicious stuff.

00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:23.373
Avocado honey, who knew?

00:26:23.456 --> 00:26:25.208
-Pretty great, right?
-[Lucifer] Mm!

00:26:26.793 --> 00:26:29.754
All right, all right.
We found out Bob was living in LA.

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.215
We didn't have any reason to kill him.

00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:34.259
My files say you and Bob hated each other.

00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:38.179
We had a rivalry. He had his whole
doorknobs thing and, as for me--

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.765
You kill people in swimming pools,
hence the name Pool Boy.

00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:43.059
It's very clever.
I see what you've done there.

00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:44.019
Allegedly killed.

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:47.314
But as we got older,
we learned to respect each other.

00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:48.815
Okay, say I believe that.

00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:52.360
Bob still put your uncle in jail
for 50 years because he testified.

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:54.070
Yeah, and we owe him for that.

00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:56.323
-What do you mean?
-Uncle Vin was a bastard.

00:26:56.531 --> 00:26:58.325
Bob did everyone a favor
by taking him out.

00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:00.785
And as for the honey,
it isn't what it looks like.

00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:03.246
It looks like you got a delicious trophy
after a kill.

00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:06.458
A couple weeks ago,

00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:09.419
we got an anonymous note
that Bob was in LA.

00:27:09.711 --> 00:27:11.880
We came here to warn him.
That's when we tried the honey.

00:27:12.672 --> 00:27:14.549
Almost as sweet as that Lenore of his.

00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:15.592
Can I see the note?

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:17.218
Wish I could help you.

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:18.637
I gave it to Bob.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.807
[Chloe] So I saw security cameras
at the farmers' market.

00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:26.269
We can check the footage to see
if Pool Boy Paradiso or anybody else

00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:28.313
visited Lenore and Bob's stand, okay?

00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:29.731
Thanks, Dan.

00:27:30.273 --> 00:27:31.941
[Lucifer] Ah. That was disappointing.

00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:33.735
[Chloe] We haven't hit a dead end yet.

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:35.695
No, no.
When I heard his name was Pool Boy,

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:37.989
I pictured
a much more Baywatch-esque suspect.

00:27:38.073 --> 00:27:39.282
[both laugh]

00:27:39.574 --> 00:27:40.992
-Listen, Detective--
-[Chloe gasps]

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:43.244
Sorry.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:44.954
What's wrong?

00:27:45.038 --> 00:27:47.165
Nothing's wrong. Nothing.
Everything's okay.

00:27:47.248 --> 00:27:48.249
I just...

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:50.669
You startled me. Everything's okay.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.429
You believe Pool Boy?

00:28:01.971 --> 00:28:02.847
Really?

00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:03.807
His story tracks.

00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:07.394
He has an alibi for the night of
the murder that completely checks out.

00:28:07.477 --> 00:28:09.437
Alibis can be bought, or threatened.

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.147
These guys are monsters, Detective Decker.

00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:12.982
And I'm not taking my eye off any of them,

00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:16.069
but I believe him when he says
that he got an anonymous tip.

00:28:16.152 --> 00:28:18.947
If the note exists,
whoever wrote it wanted Bob dead.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.115
That's who we need to find.

00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:23.201
Did Lenore know about Bob's past?

00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:25.412
I don't know. I never met her.

00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:27.080
Bob certainly wasn't
supposed to tell her,

00:28:27.163 --> 00:28:29.666
but then again he wasn't supposed
to attack a honey bee farmer

00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:31.668
with a bag full of doorknobs either, so...

00:28:32.293 --> 00:28:34.838
Look, we do our best at WITSEC,
but these guys, they...

00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:36.589
They can't help themselves.

00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:40.593
Lenore didn't seem to know
when I interviewed her, but Pool Boy...

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:43.054
He acted as if they had already met.

00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:44.848
So she knew the truth.

00:28:44.931 --> 00:28:46.182
Then maybe she saw the note.

00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:48.393
[Lucifer] Daniel, there you are.

00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:52.439
I need some advice in an area
I assume you have extensive expertise.

00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:57.819
What does it mean
when a woman recoils at your touch?

00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:02.282
Nope.

00:29:02.949 --> 00:29:04.701
I am not playing that game anymore.

00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:06.161
Excuse me?

00:29:06.494 --> 00:29:08.705
You say something insulting,
stupid, but...

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:11.374
kind of funny, and I just shrug it off.

00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:12.542
It was our schtick.

00:29:12.792 --> 00:29:14.002
But we are not friends.

00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:15.920
Not anymore.

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:19.841
But I'll tell you what,
I'll give you an answer.

00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:20.967
Thank you.

00:29:21.801 --> 00:29:22.886
It means that they hate you.

00:29:23.845 --> 00:29:26.306
That they want you
as far away from them as possible,

00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:27.891
because your very touch...

00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:29.559
makes them recoil...

00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:31.478
in disgust.

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:35.148
What? Hm?

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:37.692
No funny quip to that?

00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:46.326
Hey.

00:29:47.494 --> 00:29:48.328
Where's Lucifer?

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:52.540
I don't know and I don't care.

00:29:52.832 --> 00:29:55.752
Well, he was supposed to come with me
to interview Lenore.

00:29:55.835 --> 00:29:57.462
Well, I guess it's just you and me.

00:29:58.171 --> 00:30:00.632
[Lucifer] The Detective
is in deeper denial than I thought.

00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:07.180
All right, I'm going to give you advice
on how to help her.

00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:08.681
Finally. Thank you, Doctor.

00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:11.559
But I'm going to need a good metaphor.
Hmm.

00:30:12.227 --> 00:30:13.686
Let's use...

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:14.896
you...

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.189
as an example.

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:19.442
Oh, role play. It's been a while, Doctor.

00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:22.195
We don't have the clown masks with us,
but I'm still game.

00:30:22.278 --> 00:30:23.947
Okay. Well, If you were in denial,

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.326
and if that denial forced you
to face a truth that...

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:32.956
scared you
more than you'd like to admit...

00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:34.541
Go on.

00:30:34.624 --> 00:30:37.001
I'd say that you were
projecting your issues

00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:39.754
onto whatever you were dealing with
in that moment.

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.339
Or...

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.676
whomever you were dealing with.

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:45.593
[sighs]

00:30:46.302 --> 00:30:48.513
I see what you're saying, Doctor.
Thank you.

00:30:49.472 --> 00:30:50.557
Do you?

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:54.435
Well, the Detective is clearly
projecting her issues onto the case.

00:30:54.602 --> 00:30:57.856
So to understand her, I need to use the
case to help her understand her feelings.

00:30:58.064 --> 00:30:59.649
And in so doing,

00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:02.068
understand your own feelings as well?

00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:04.863
[Lucifer scoffs]

00:31:11.244 --> 00:31:12.871
Hey, Dan, I've been meaning to say,

00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:15.164
you know, I... I'm sorry
that I wasn't here for you

00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:16.708
when you were dealing with...

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.876
well, everything.

00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:20.253
[Dan] I don't know how much
of a difference it'd have made.

00:31:20.336 --> 00:31:22.088
I just threw myself into work, you know?

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:24.424
[Chloe] No, but still, now I'm here
to pick up the slack,

00:31:24.507 --> 00:31:26.509
so if you want to,
take some time off to mourn.

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:30.013
The job is kind of like my therapy.
It's exactly where I need to be right now.

00:31:30.847 --> 00:31:32.348
Okay, but you know, I'm here to talk.

00:31:32.432 --> 00:31:33.308
Look, I know.

00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:35.727
And thank you.

00:31:37.937 --> 00:31:39.314
There is something, though.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.356
What's up?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.234
What's Trixie's obsession with gelato?

00:31:43.776 --> 00:31:44.611
Oh, my God.

00:31:44.694 --> 00:31:47.488
It was hard getting her to leave Rome
after she discovered that stuff.

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:48.990
[suspenseful music playing]

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:18.394
Okay, so the neighbor saw Lenore leave
carrying a gym bag,

00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:20.188
alone and in a hurry.
She took her own car.

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:23.066
So what? She was involved
in her husband's murder and then ran?

00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:24.901
She could have written the anonymous note.

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:28.821
When it didn't work, maybe she killed him
herself or found someone else to do it.

00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:31.532
[Lucifer] Or she found out the truth
about the man she loved

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:32.742
and it drove her away.

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:36.037
What do you think she would have felt
in that moment? Horror? Disgust?

00:32:36.245 --> 00:32:37.246
Mild arousal?

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.666
I don't think that's really helping
right now, Lucifer.

00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:42.919
Understanding her perspective will help us
understand her actions, Detective.

00:32:44.003 --> 00:32:46.339
You know what?
You know, that's a good point.

00:32:46.422 --> 00:32:49.008
I'm sure she felt betrayed...

00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:51.719
Confused. Scared, even.

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:54.889
Is that why you think she ran?
Because she was afraid of him?

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.267
Lenore may have lied
about what she knew about Bob,

00:32:58.351 --> 00:33:00.353
but she was genuinely grief-stricken
at the crime scene.

00:33:00.436 --> 00:33:02.230
So I think we're missing something.

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:03.523
Ella, what did she leave with?

00:33:03.606 --> 00:33:07.360
Clothes, toiletries. Your standard
get-the-hell-out-of-town go bag.

00:33:07.443 --> 00:33:08.611
Oh, and...

00:33:09.737 --> 00:33:10.780
her wedding album.

00:33:11.739 --> 00:33:14.575
You don't take a wedding album
if you've murdered your husband.

00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:17.620
[Chloe] Dan, what did you see
on the farmers' market footage?

00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:20.498
Just one visit from Pool Boy Paradiso,
like he claimed.

00:33:20.581 --> 00:33:22.959
Oh, and Marshal Reynolds.
A couple of times, actually.

00:33:23.042 --> 00:33:25.670
And was it only Bob
that Reynolds was talking to?

00:33:25.753 --> 00:33:27.839
Well, he spoke to Lenore once. Why?

00:33:27.922 --> 00:33:29.507
Well, he said that they had never met.

00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:36.305
I don't-- I'm fine.
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:38.850
[Linda]
Maze, you and I both know that's not true.

00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:40.935
Trixie means a lot to you.

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:43.229
And she's the last person
you need to make up with

00:33:43.312 --> 00:33:45.690
since your backslide into demon-dom.

00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:46.649
I'm...

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:49.277
Okay, Linda, what is going on with you?

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.029
Do you need to pee or something?

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:54.615
No. I sit all day. It's nice to be able
to move around when I get a chance.

00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:56.409
Okay.

00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:58.911
So let's talk about
what you're dealing with emotionally.

00:33:59.454 --> 00:34:00.705
Yeah, I really don't want to.

00:34:00.788 --> 00:34:02.957
Maybe it would help
if I spoke your language.

00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:04.000
You speak Lilim?

00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:09.130
[speaking in Lilim in a deep voice]

00:34:09.922 --> 00:34:10.798
What?

00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:12.925
No, guess not.

00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:15.219
No, I'm talking about violence.

00:34:15.595 --> 00:34:16.429
Come on, stand up.

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:17.597
Okay.

00:34:17.972 --> 00:34:20.933
One, I like to fight when I'm happy or...

00:34:21.517 --> 00:34:22.435
horny.

00:34:22.685 --> 00:34:26.981
And, two, I really don't want
to accidentally kill my best friend.

00:34:27.523 --> 00:34:29.609
No. Well, I think you
underestimate me, Maze.

00:34:29.692 --> 00:34:31.944
Uh, I've been doing some kickboxing.

00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:32.945
I've got moves.

00:34:34.113 --> 00:34:34.989
Um...

00:34:36.657 --> 00:34:37.700
I'll let you take a free--

00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:38.868
Hey!

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:41.454
-Linda!
-Stop it, you two.

00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:42.872
It's good I'm here.

00:34:42.955 --> 00:34:45.416
I can't allow you guys to fight over me
any longer.

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:47.710
-Uh...
-Oh...

00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:50.088
Ah, you're not fighting over me,

00:34:50.671 --> 00:34:51.506
are you?

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.343
No, but it's sweet of you to think so.

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.469
[Linda chuckles]

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:58.471
We made up a month or so ago.

00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:01.307
So do you need my help?

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.184
With this or...

00:35:04.894 --> 00:35:06.521
anything else?

00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:07.980
No, we're good.

00:35:08.272 --> 00:35:09.190
[Maze] We're good.

00:35:10.858 --> 00:35:12.360
[Linda] Are you okay?

00:35:13.236 --> 00:35:15.279
I went back home to the Silver City.

00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:18.074
That's amazing.

00:35:18.157 --> 00:35:20.827
It should be.
It's exactly as I remembered it, but...

00:35:23.246 --> 00:35:25.081
Why did it feel so...

00:35:26.707 --> 00:35:27.542
different?

00:35:29.043 --> 00:35:30.169
Why didn't it feel like...

00:35:31.003 --> 00:35:31.879
Like home?

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:34.966
[sighs]

00:35:35.049 --> 00:35:37.176
Because this is your home.

00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:43.057
[Chloe] Ugh.

00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:45.184
I'm just getting Reynolds' voicemail.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.186
Any luck tracing his phone?

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:51.023
I'm triangulating it now.
Not sure how long it'll take, though.

00:35:51.107 --> 00:35:53.109
Or whether or not
he had anything to do with this.

00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:56.946
I think he did. I made a couple
of discreet calls to the Marshals' office.

00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:59.198
Two of the ex-cons under
Reynolds' protection

00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:00.741
have died in the last couple years.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.285
-Who killed them?
-That's it.

00:36:02.368 --> 00:36:03.744
One was an angry girlfriend.

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:06.414
The other was a hit and run
that looked like it was mob-related.

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:09.750
So our dear Marshal weaponized
the very secrets only he knew.

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:12.879
He let certain enemies know
where the criminals were hiding.

00:36:12.962 --> 00:36:15.882
Or told the new wives the truth,
knowing how betrayed they'd feel.

00:36:15.965 --> 00:36:18.050
And voila, the dirty work
was done for him.

00:36:18.134 --> 00:36:19.427
That is remarkably efficient.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.345
But in Bob's case, nobody took the bait.

00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:25.600
So maybe Reynolds got frustrated
and decided to get his own hands dirty?

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:26.601
The question is, why?

00:36:26.934 --> 00:36:29.103
I'll keep digging, see if I can find more.

00:36:32.273 --> 00:36:34.275
So, why did Lenore run?

00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:36.652
Well, if Reynolds met with her
previously...

00:36:37.236 --> 00:36:38.779
then probably she trusts him.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.617
So maybe he reached out to her
to tell her she was in danger.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.911
Oh, and little did she know
how true that was.

00:36:44.994 --> 00:36:48.539
Just got a hit on Reynolds' GPS, so,
you know, it might be a good idea to...

00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:52.001
[whispers] You guys got this.

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.344
[whimpering] Why?

00:37:01.427 --> 00:37:02.762
Why are you doing this?

00:37:03.971 --> 00:37:04.847
Please...

00:37:05.264 --> 00:37:07.767
[sobbing] Please tell me. Don't! Don't.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:08.684
I'm sorry.

00:37:09.852 --> 00:37:11.312
-There's no other way.
-Please, don't.

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:12.730
[Lucifer] Sure there is!

00:37:12.813 --> 00:37:15.524
There are loads of ways to kill her.
Literally tons.

00:37:16.317 --> 00:37:19.612
But you chose to use
Frank "Pool Boy" Paradiso's MO

00:37:19.695 --> 00:37:21.530
to frame him and tie up loose ends.

00:37:22.031 --> 00:37:22.990
It's very clever.

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:25.368
[Chloe] Drop the gun, Reynolds. Step away.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.870
You don't understand.
I'm not the bad guy here.

00:37:27.954 --> 00:37:30.373
I've watched all these criminals
for years,

00:37:30.456 --> 00:37:34.669
living happy lives, being rewarded
for the terrible things that they did.

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:37.421
Lenore's done nothing wrong. Let her go.

00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:40.007
Oh, hasn't she? She forgave him.

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:43.386
Even when he was exactly the same monster
he'd always been.

00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:46.806
You saw what he did to the guy
at the farmers' market. They never change.

00:37:46.889 --> 00:37:50.393
So maybe he slipped up.
We all do sometimes.

00:37:51.185 --> 00:37:54.021
But at least he was trying
to make a better life for himself.

00:37:55.523 --> 00:37:56.774
And you stole it.

00:37:56.857 --> 00:37:58.609
You... You step back.

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:00.945
Lucifer, don't!

00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:03.823
It's not your job to punish,
Marshal Reynolds.

00:38:04.156 --> 00:38:05.783
It's mine. [snarls]

Nah. I couldn't stay mad at you.

Whoa, I'm sorry man, I...

00:41:14.054 --> 00:41:16.140
I must have been in my own head.
I thought I was alone.

00:41:17.391 --> 00:41:18.601
Where the hell have you been?

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:20.394
I went home for a bit.

00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:22.271
And no phones there?

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.314
Actually, no.

00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:24.815
Oh.

00:41:26.442 --> 00:41:28.777
Dan, you're the most human person
that I know.

00:41:30.738 --> 00:41:31.572
Thanks?

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.616
What made you choose to live here?

00:41:34.617 --> 00:41:35.743

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:37.036

00:41:41.624 --> 00:41:42.708

it's become my home now, too.

And it's time that I stop trying
to make excuses for wanting to stay

00:41:58.057 --> 00:41:59.683
and choose to stay.

[shudders]

00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:58.302
But it's not all that I am.

00:44:01.555 --> 00:44:02.765
At least I hope not.

00:44:03.515 --> 00:44:04.933
[sighs]

00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:08.103
Either way, it's unfair of me
to expect you to just...

00:44:09.271 --> 00:44:10.105
accept it.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.317
I'm honestly not sure
when I'll be able to.

00:44:13.776 --> 00:44:15.110
[laughs]

00:44:15.194 --> 00:44:16.028
If ever.

00:44:21.742 --> 00:44:24.244
Lucifer, what I was going to say was...

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.081
What I saw...

00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:32.211
was my partner.

00:44:39.468 --> 00:44:40.302
Really?

00:44:42.388 --> 00:44:43.263
Really.

00:44:45.974 --> 00:44:46.934
Well, then...

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.687
problem solved, Detective.

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:52.731
Because if you can accept me, then...

00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:56.318
that really is all that matters.

00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:58.737
[laughs]

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.246
[slow organ music playing]

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:45.325
[inhales deeply]

00:45:56.879 --> 00:45:58.756
[sobbing quietly]

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:05.012
[sobs]

00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:21.528
We knew this part would be difficult,
Chloe.

00:46:26.658 --> 00:46:28.702
But just remember, what you're doing...

00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:31.455
is the best thing for everyone on Earth.

00:46:33.916 --> 00:46:35.083
Including Lucifer.

00:46:40.088 --> 00:46:40.964
I know.

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:47.554
Are you ready for the next step?

00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:50.974
[sniffles]

00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:53.519
I am.
